# daily-doc

About the Project
The project leverages the OpenAI ChatGPT model to provide a conversational experience with a medical expert. It utilizes the Gradio library to create a user-friendly web interface.

The main.py file contains the main Python script that sets up the Gradio interface and handles user interactions. The requirements.txt file lists the required Python dependencies for running the project.
